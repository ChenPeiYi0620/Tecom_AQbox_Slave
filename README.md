This is the source code of the proposed motor electrical metering box, including 
1. Basic MCU set up (CPU clock setting, Intterupt configuration, watchdog, Extenal memory interface and other system initialization)
2. Periphral configuraton (GPIO, PWM, ADC, DAC, sci, spi ) for data sampling and debugging
3. Real-time volatge recontrcutiono
4. Motor state observer for Flux, speed, Torque and Angle estimation
5. Fault detection for dmeagnetization and turn-fault
6. Real-time data communication
